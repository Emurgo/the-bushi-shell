## Case Design
### Objective:
      - Provide a complete open source guide to run a Cardano Rust full node in single-board computers like Rockpi
      - Open source 3D printable case designs
     

### Requirements:
     - The casing must withstand an average impact force of at least 16 N to withstand a fall from a table. 
     - Must have room for two LEDs for displaying the power and the status
     - Ensure that all essential ports are exposed with at least 0.4mm of tolerence for easier installation. 
     - Find a material that can economically absorb impact force to ensure the case can protect the Pi in different environments. 
     - Ensure that the casing can be aesthetically pleasing to attract more people to download and improve the case. 

### Prototype 1 (Futuristic Curve):

- This case would be different than the current ones out in the market. With a sleak curved design, this case would not only be able to protect the case, but look aestheically pleasing as well to distinguish our design from the rest of the community. In turn, more people would be incline to modify the design to fit their needs. 

#### Lid design: 
     - After conducting research on the different designs of casings for microcomputers, stakeboxes, and other microprocessing devices, I came to the conclustion that this system should have a double locking system to ensure that the case stays in place even in the event of a fall. 
     - The case accomplishes this by having 3 step locking system bound to a curve. These are the steps to open the case: 
         
           1.) Pull the lid slightly
           2.) Slide the lid down the curve of the case until it stops
           3.) Pull off the lid for access to the internal devices
      
    - By implementing this system, it would be able to prevent premature removal of the top protection of the device.

      Note: There are still some modificaitons to be done. 

      - Currently, this system is still undergoing statical analysis to see if it is ready for production.
