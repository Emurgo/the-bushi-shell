## Pi Case Anaylsis 
 ### Steps for building a pi case: 
      
      1.) Plan 
          - Draw a model of the Pi with dimensions
          - Analyze what components will be used for the project 
          - Think about what material you would like to use because that could influence the strucutre of your design
                 
                 Here is an analysis of different material properies for the constuction of the outer casing:

                           Pros:                      
                             - Durable
                             - Extremely Flexable 

                           Cons:
                             - Must print slow to prevent clogs
                             - Very difficult to print with
          
      2.) Design
          - Integrate every aspect that would improve the performance of the item enclosed
          - Take into consideration the size of the case should have clearance of AT LEAST 0.4mm 
          - Model the whole case first then split it in two and if possible, try designing a snapfits for connecting the two
          - IMPORTANT: Always add ventilation to the case to prevent overheating
          
      3.) Test
          - Conduct internal structual analysis to ensure that the case can withstand a certain amount of force without damaging internal components
          - Export your model as an STL file or whichever file your tool can translate to construct the prototype
          - Configure the internal properties of the system
              - For 3D Printers: 
                  - For the strongest and most economical option, try printing with 15% infill and 4 Shells
                  - The more shells, the longer it takes to print but the stronger the product will become
                  
 ### Notes from other Designs
      - All current stakeboxes are simlar in design. These cases gives access to all the ports in the pi. 
      - The Casa node includes a interchangable power connection so people can use their device anywhere in the world. 
      - Some designs, such as the casa node, contains an external hard drive to increase diskspace for extra storage of transactions. 
 
 ## Case Design
 ### Objectives:
     - The casing must withstand an average impact force of at least 16 N to withstand a fall from a table. 
     - Must have room for two LEDs for displaying the power and the status
     - Ensure that all essential ports are exposed with at least 0.4mm of tolerence for easier installation. 
     - Find a material that can economically absorb impact force to ensure the case can protect the Pi in different environments. 
     - Ensure that the casing can be aesthetically pleasing to attract more people to download and improve the case. 

### Prototype 1 (Futuristic Curve):

- This case would be different than the current ones out in the market. With a sleak curved design, this case would not only be able to protect the case, but look aestheically pleasing as well to distinguish our design from the rest of the community. In turn, more people would be incline to modify the design to fit their needs. 

    Lid design: 
      - After conducting research on the different designs of casings for microcomputers, stakeboxes, and other microprocessing devices, I came to the conclustion that this system should have a double locking system to ensure that the case stays in place even in the event of a fall. 
      - The case accomplishes this by having 3 step locking system bound to a curve. These are the steps to open the case: 
         
          1.) Pull the lid slightly
          2.) Slide the lid down the curve of the case until it stops
          3.) Pull off the lid for access to the internal devices
      
      - By implementing this system, it would be able to prevent premature removal of the top protection of the device.

      Note: There are still some modificaitons to be done. 

      - Currently, this system is still undergoing statical analysis to see if it is ready for production.
