# The Bushi Shell Project

## **Plan**
### **CAD Comparison Analysis**

The following document contains the pros and cons of the different Computer-Aided Design software that could be used for future development of prototypes: 
[CAD Programs](docs/CADComparison.md)

### **Pi Case Design Research**

Here contains the layout of the process of designing a microcomputer case: 
[Pi Design Research Findings](docs/PiResearch.md)

## **Design**
### **Objective:**
 - Provide a complete open source guide to run a Cardano Rust full node in single-board computers like Rockpi

- Open source 3D printable case designs
     

### **Requirements:**
 - The casing must withstand an average impact force of at least 16 N to withstand a fall from a table. 

 - Must have room for two LEDs for displaying the power and the status
 - Ensure that all essential ports are exposed with at least 0.4mm of tolerence for easier installation. 
 - Find a material that can economically absorb impact force to ensure the case can protect the Pi in different environments. 
 - Ensure that the casing can be aesthetically pleasing to attract more people to download and improve the case. 

### **Microcomputer Dimensions:**
- The documents below provides a reference on the locations of different locations of components, gaps, and ports of different microcomputer systems to aid the designing process: 
  
  - [RockPi 4B](docs/RockPiDimensions.md)
  - [RaspberryPi 4B](docs/RaspberryPiDimensions.md)*    

###### ***Must be measured**

### **Case Prototypes:**
   ### ***Prototype 1***
   #### Codename: [Hideyoshi](docs/Hideyoshi.md)
   #### **Status:** 
   ** Discontinued for risk of printing difficulty **

   ### ***Prototype 2*** 
   #### Codename: [Oda](docs/Oda.md)
   #### **Status:** 
   ** Discontinued for severe design issues **

   ### ***Prototype 3*** 
   #### Codename: [Meiji](docs/Meiji.md)
   #### **Status:** 
   *Design Phase*    


### **3D Printing Guide:**
- Once the designing process is complete, it is important to know what material would be benificial to be used for printing these components. This list contains the pros and cons of the most retable plastics that are commonly used by most 3D printers: [3D Printer Filiment Types](docs/3DPrinterPlastics.md)
