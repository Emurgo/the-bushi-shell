## CAD Comparison Analysis

Name | Price | Capabilities | Pros | Cons | Possible Uses 
---- | ----- | ------------ | ---- | ---- | -------------
Autodesk AutoCAD/Inventor | Free for students | Modeling, assembling, and drafting prototypes as well as test product's durabilites using stress and dynmaic simulations | * Easy-to-Use / * Effective stuctual analysis system / * Short learning curve / * Installed STL file conversion | * Requires a lot of data / * At random times it crashes completely | Run accurate stuctural simulations on large assemblies
Onshape | Free for Students | An online cloud-based CAD program that utilizes the same functions as other CAD programs such as Modeling, assembly, drafting and analysis | * All progress is saved in a private server so all work is automatically saved. / * Can be worked on any computer like Google docs. / * Community of professionals readibly accessible / * Easy to share to public | * Low graphic quality / * File inflexiblity (Cannot use files but you can store and redownload them) | Store copies of files created for future reference or to share in the public domain.
Fusion360 | Free for Students or non-student: $60/month | A cloud-based CAD software that allows multiple users to work on a single project | * Keeps track of changes to a project / * Excellent graphics / * Able to run multiple structure tests simultaneously / * Ability to select individual components to export as STL files | * Difficult to customize software | Running a linked CAD file for easier visualization of progress made
Solidworks | Free for Students | Modeling, assembling, and drafting prototypes as well as test product's durabilites using stress and dynmaic simulations | * Short learning curve / * Built-in cost estimation feature / * Able to view complex surfaces | * Poor ergonomics / * Cannot handle large assemblies well | Calculate the cost of production for the project and what materials would be financially beneficial to use
