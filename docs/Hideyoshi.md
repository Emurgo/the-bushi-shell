## Plan:

#### Lid design: 
     - After conducting research on the different designs of casings for microcomputers, stakeboxes, and other microprocessing devices, I came to the conclustion that this system should have a double locking system to ensure that the case stays in place even in the event of a fall. 
     - The case accomplishes this by having 3 step locking system bound to a curve. These are the steps to open the case: 
         
           1.) Pull the lid slightly
           2.) Slide the lid down the curve of the case until it stops
           3.) Pull off the lid for access to the internal devices
      
    - By implementing this system, it would be able to prevent premature removal of the top protection of the device.

      Note: There are still some modificaitons to be done. 

      - Currently, this system is still undergoing statical analysis to see if it is ready for production. 

## **Issues with this design**:
- Not 3D printing friendly
- Difficult to open/close
- Potentially economically costly to produce
- Does not put into account addons to the Pi
