# Brainstorming:
## Background:
  This design was inspired by the structure of stackable bento boxes and LEGOS. If one part is not needed, then it should be able to be removed and assembled again with ease. The point of this design is provide a set of stackable layers that could be customizable to fit the user's need alongside hosting the Pi. 

### **What will this model include?**
- Layered surfaces for individual internal design but same base design

- Male clips on the bottom and female indents on top for easy removal or installation of extensions (Breadboard, Hard drives, Fans, etc.)
- Heavy ventilation on the bottom layer 
- Three holes on each side for extra ventilation
- Male/female groves around the edges of the top and bottom of each case to add friction between both surfaces to ensure proper connection and prevent movement. 

### **What would it look like?**

**WARNING:** Ignore the note in the picture

**Note**: This is only a draft of the design and is subject to modification. 


### **Possible problems and solutions**:
***Problem 1***: Long design process
  
 **Possible Solutions**:
  
  1.) Make a template of the outside shell of the layer to be used for every layer 
  2.) Avoid complex designs unless for support.
