# Brainstorming:

### **What will this model include?**
- Layered surfaces for individual internal design but same base design

- Male clips on the bottom and female indents on top for easy removal or installation of extensions (Breadboard, Hard drives, Fans, etc.)
- Heavy ventilation on the bottom layer 
- Three holes on each side for extra ventilation
- Male/female groves around the edges of the top and bottom of each case to add friction between both surfaces to ensure proper connection and prevent movement. 

### **What would it look like?**
