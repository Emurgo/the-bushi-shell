### Plan:
 - Case will be made up of a top and a bottom components.

 - **Case Dimensions (Estimate):** 95 x 60 x 30 (mm) 
 - There will be three different lock systems (clip, double slot, and pin lock) to ensure that the case does not come off unless the user requests it. 

 #### Bottom 

    - A Heat sink will be included alongside with the Pi  that would require a 1-3mm washer 
  
    - Ensure a 0.05mm threshold between the case and the associated port. This is to make sure that the case will truely fit the Pi. 
   
    - Creation of male connection pins on the area where holes appear on the Pi. The pins are design to be one element that would aid on the prevention of movement of the device.
   
    - Design bumps that will properly connect to a double lock device on the top case.

   ##### Possible Add-on Ideas:
     - Corner clips to keep the pi in place while not causing damage to the corners.
     - An upper enclosure that would hug around the pi when the case is closing.

 #### Top

##### Locking Mechanisms
    - The Lid of the case will consist of 3 different locking mechanisms:
    
    1.) Clip locks: This clip would attach when the system is fully in position to prevent movement of the case as a whole.

    2.) Screw lock: For the Pi and heatsink screws will be included on all four corners to secure the Pi and heatsink in place. 

    3.) Double-Slot: A zig-zag lock that would require the user to slightly pull up, slide forward, then take out the lid. This is to ensure that the lid does not come off unless the user desires. 

## Issues with the design:
- Does not account for add-ons to the Pi
- Possible issues with installation
- Impractical 
- Bland
- No room to add supports without intruding on installation
