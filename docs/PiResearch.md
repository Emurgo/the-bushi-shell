 ### Steps for building a pi case: 
      
    1.) Plan 
          - Draw a model of the Pi with dimensions
          - Analyze what components will be used for the project 
          - Think about what material you would like to use because that could influence the strucutre of your design
                 

      2.) Design
          - Integrate every aspect that would improve the performance of the item enclosed
          - Take into consideration the size of the case should have clearance of AT LEAST 0.4mm 
          - Model the whole case first then split it in two and if possible, try designing a snapfits for connecting the two
          - IMPORTANT: Always add ventilation to the case to prevent overheating
          
      3.) Test
          - Conduct internal structual analysis to ensure that the case can withstand a certain amount of force without damaging internal components
          - Export your model as an STL file or whichever file your tool can translate to construct the prototype
          - Configure the internal properties of the system
              - For 3D Printers: 
                  - For the strongest and most economical option, try printing with 15% infill and 4 Shells
                  - The more shells, the longer it takes to print but the stronger the product will become
